    <content type="html">I enjoy talking about religion in general but a few specific events are prompting this blog post. First, my wife has recently been getting more involved with her church and we&#39;ve been hanging out with her church friends, so church and religion and God has been a topic of conversation around here. Second, my daughter&#39;s boyfriend asked her why I didn&#39;t believe. Finally, one of my friends recently asked me why do I care about religion if I don&#39;t believe it.</content>
